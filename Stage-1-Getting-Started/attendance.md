# Stage 1 Attendance Policy for Fellows

This document outlines the attendance requirements for fellows in Stage 1 of our program. Our policy is designed to ensure active participation and engagement, which are crucial for the fellows' progress and success. 

### Key Highlights:

1. **Ongoing Updates**: 
   - The attendance list for Stage 1 fellows is a living document.
   - We report total time (minutes) a fellow attend each session
   - It will be regularly updated following each session to reflect the most current attendance data.

2. **Critical Attendance Threshold**: 
   - Fellows are required to maintain a minimum of 90% attendance throughout Stage 1.
   - This threshold is essential for fellows to qualify for progression to the next stage of the program, which focuses on Data Science.

3. **Purpose of the Requirement**: 
   - **Consistency in Learning**: Regular attendance ensures that fellows are consistently engaged with the program material.
   - **Peer Learning and Collaboration**: High attendance fosters a collaborative learning environment.
   - **Support for Fellows**: Fellows facing difficulties in meeting the attendance requirement should communicate with program coordinators for assistance.
