# Getting Started with VSCode for Data Science

Welcome to this beginner's guide on using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for data science. This guide will walk you through setting up VSCode, using Jupyter notebooks, and getting started with a data science project.

## Setting Up VSCode

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code
- Download and install VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 2: Install Python Extension
- Open VSCode.
- Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
- Search for `Python` and install the extension by Microsoft.

## Working with Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode

### Step 3: Open or Create a Jupyter Notebook
- Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `Jupyter: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook`.
- Alternatively, you can open an existing `.ipynb` file.

### Step 4: Install Jupyter
- If you don't have Jupyter installed, you will be prompted to install it. Follow the instructions provided.

### Step 5: Run Notebook Cells
- Write your Python code in a cell.
- Use `Shift+Enter` to run the cell and see the output below the cell.

## Starting a Data Science Project

### Step 6: Create a Project Folder
- Choose a location on your computer and create a new folder for your project.

### Step 7: Open the Folder in VSCode
- In VSCode, go to `File > Open Folder` and select your project folder.

### Step 8: Install Data Science Libraries
- Open a terminal in VSCode (`Terminal > New Terminal`).
- Install necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or Matplotlib using `pip`. For example:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

### Step 9: Explore Data

Create a new Jupyter notebook following the steps above.
Import libraries and start exploring your data.
Step 10: Save and Share Your Notebook
Save your work by clicking on the save icon or using Ctrl+S.
You can share your .ipynb notebook file with others, or upload it to a repository on GitHub.
